# ComplexDomainOnsetDetection
Onset detection algorithm for music signals I'm implementing during my bachelor's degree internship.

My work relies mainly on these papers: <br>
[On the Use of Phase and Energy for Musical OnsetDetection in the Complex Domain](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/former/people/jbc/Documents/Bello-SPL-2004.pdf) <br>
[A Tutorial on Onset Detection in Music Signals](https://www.academia.edu/881824/A_Tutorial_on_Onset_Detection_In_Music_Signals) <br>
[Drum Source Separation using Percussive Feature Detection and Spectral Modulation](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.598.2552&rep=rep1&type=pdf) <br>
